abstract: The Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is the most important small pelagic 
  of the Humboldt Current System (HCS), supporting the largest mono-specific fishery in 
  the world. The spatial behavior of this species tends to bevery dynamic at different 
  spatial scales, influenced mostly by its biomass level and environmental factors. The 
  aim of this study was to analyze temporal and spatial fluctuations in anchovy spatial 
  distribution off Peru, based and modeled on acoustic data, focusing on large- and meso-scale 
  spatial structures. We employed data from 41 scientific surveys (1994–2016) and Bayesian hierarchical 
  spatial models to obtain the anchovy's spatial distribution, allowing us to identify spatial 
  structures at specific scales. Our results showed similar temporal trends in the number of mesoscale 
  structures, their areas and anchovy density, exhibiting altogether two breakpoints in the time 
  series 1999 and 2013. The last period (2013–2016) was similar to the earlier one (1994–1999), 
  in terms of low values of mesoscale structure indicators. On the other hand, we identified four
  spatial scenarios differentiated by the aggregative behavior, which were highly influenced by seasons 
  and El Niño events. Each scenario had recurrent, or fidelity, areas placed in different locations. For 
  instance, for the ‘El Niño scenario’ a particularly coastal recurrent area was identified, which might 
  be a refuge zone for this species during these unfavorable events. Finally, we assessed differences in 
  biomass estimates of each scenario. The highest biomass values were estimated for the ‘Summer favorable 
  scenario’ and the lowest ones for the ‘El Niño scenario’, which supports the MacCall's basin hypothesis 
  for this species. This study expands the current knowledge of the Peruvian anchovy and it is a first 
  step to understand the effects on this species of the last El Niño events (2014–2016) that occurred in 
  the northern Humboldt Current System.
