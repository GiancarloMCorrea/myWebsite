summary: Continuation ratio logit, a ordinal multinomial model, has been used to model proportions at age of fish individuals in the age subsample using generalized additive models (GAM) for estimation. It can be applied to any fish stock, either using survey or fisheries data. The user can specify the explanatory variables. More details can be found in this repository.
