abstract: Distinct types of fish species experience variation in somatic growth rates over 
  their life span; however, growth has historically been assumed to be invariant across time 
  and space in integrated analysis-based stock assessment. A few previous studies have reported 
  biased and imprecise assessment model outcomes when variability in somatic growth was ignored. 
  In this study, we used a simulation-estimation framework to expand previous analyses and to 
  examine the consequences of ignoring or incorporating spatial and temporal (year- and 
  cohort-specific) variability in somatic growth in stock assessment models. The study included 
  three life history types: small pelagic (e.g. sardine), gadids (e.g. cod), and long-lived (e.g. rockfish). 
  In general, ignoring any type of variability in somatic growth led to biased and imprecise estimates of 
  stock spawning biomass and management quantities. Unequal distribution of fishing mortality across space 
  had large impacts on the performance of estimation models as well. Conversely, accounting for somatic 
  growth variability, either by including an environmental index, estimating annual deviates, or 
  implementing a spatially explicit model, produced unbiased and precise results. This study shows 
  that somatic growth variability might produce large effects in stock assessments when ignored and 
  provides pertinent information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.
