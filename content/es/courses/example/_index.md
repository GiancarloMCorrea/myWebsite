- **Day 1:** Basics of R programming. Descriptive statistics. Introduction to probability.
- **Day 2:** Hypothesis testing: one and two samples.
- **Day 3:** Linear models.
- **Day 4:** Introduction to time series analysis. Introduction to analysis of spatial data.
- **Day 5:** Introduction to community ecology. Types of diversity. Basics of cluster analysis.

## Objectives

- Introduce statistical concepts used in ecology
- Interpret statistical outcomes of statistical models
- Familiarize with the R programming language applied to ecology
