abstract: Temporal variability in biological parameters (i.e., population processes) is common among fish 
  stocks and may substantially impact the outputs of stock assessments. Growth variability is an important 
  contributor to biomass fluctuations in several stocks, and its incorporation in assessment models has 
  received more attention in recent years. State-space models (SSM) have also garnered attention recently 
  due to their ability to estimate time variation in biological and fisheries processes like recruitment, 
  natural mortality, catchability and selectivity. For example, the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) is a 
  U.S. east coast age-structured SSM with flexible options to model time variation with random effects directly 
  on the process, or via incorporation of environmental covariates, treating the true, unobserved values as 
  random effects. However, current SSMs like WHAM cannot model time-varying growth internally, nor accept 
  length data, and so the benefits of estimating time-varying growth cannot be explored for many stocks. In 
  this study, we expand WHAM to incorporate new approaches to modeling changes in growth using a combination 
  of parametric and non-parametric approaches while fitting to length and weight data. We implemented a 
  simulation experiment to compare the performance of these modeling approaches under different scenarios. 
  This study presents the first SSM that can be applied when length data are a key source of information, 
  variation in growth is an essential part of the dynamics of the assessed stock, or when linking climate 
  variables to growth in hindcasts or forecasts is relevant. Consequently, the importance of state-space 
  approaches and growth variation can be tested across a broader range of fish stocks worldwide, helping 
  to develop best practices and contribute to improving fisheries management goals.
