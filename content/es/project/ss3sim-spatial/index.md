summary: The *ss3sim* package (v1.0.3), originally developed by Sean Anderson (Anderson *et al*, 2014), was modified to enable it to simulate spatially explicit operating models (more than 1 area is allowed). The estimation models can have a number of areas equal or less than the operating model. This modification may be useful to evaluate spatial variability in biological parameters or fishing mortality.
