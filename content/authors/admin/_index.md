I was born in Lima, Peru, where I spent almost my whole life. I received a BS in Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Fisheries Sciences at the National University of San Marcos (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, UNMSM, the oldest university in America). Prior to beginning my graduate education at Oregon State University, I worked for 4 years as a fisheries scientist at the Marine Institut of Peru (Instituto del Mar del Peru, IMARPE). During that time, I also pursued MS studies in applied mathematics at UNMSM. My research interests include spatiotemporal dynamics of commercially important fisheries, especially in the northern Humboldt Current System and the Bering Sea, fish stock assessment models, and individual-based models. My current research focuses on incorporating spatiotemporal variability in life-history traits in fish stock assessment models. I speak Spanish, English, and Italian. I love playing soccer and dancing salsa.
