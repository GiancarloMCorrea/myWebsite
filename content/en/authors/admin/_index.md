I was born in Lima, Peru, where I spent most of my life. I got a BSc in Biological Sciences with major in Fisheries Sciences at the National University of San Marcos (Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, UNMSM, the oldest university in America). Before beginning my Ph.D. studies, I worked for four and half years as a fisheries scientist at the Marine Instituto of Peru (Instituto del Mar del Perú, IMARPE), where I studied the population dynamics and spatial ecology of small pelagic fish in the northern Humboldt Current System. During that time, I also pursued M.S. studies in Applied Mathematics at UNMSM. In Fall 2018, I became a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University, where I studied the impacts of climate on fish somatic growth using population dynamics models. I joined [the Punt’s Lab](http://puntlab.washington.edu/) in Spring 2022 as a Postdoctoral Fellow. My research interests include spatiotemporal dynamics of commercially important fisheries, especially in the northern Humboldt Current System and the Bering Sea, fish stock assessment models, and individual-based models. I love dancing, cooking, and playing soccer. I speak Spanish, English, and Italian.
