I was born in Lima, Peru. I earned a BSc in Biological Sciences with major in Fisheries Sciences at the San Marcos National University (UNMSM, the oldest university in America). I worked for four and half years as a fisheries scientist at the Marine Institute of Peru (Instituto del Mar del Perú, IMARPE), where I studied the population dynamics and spatial ecology of small pelagic fishes in the northern Humboldt Current System. During that time, I also pursued M.S. studies in Applied Mathematics at UNMSM. In Fall 2018, I moved to Oregon, U.S. to become a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University. For my Ph.D., I studied the impacts of climate on fish somatic growth using population dynamics models. I started a postdoctoral position at the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington in Spring 2022. In Spring 2023, I became a researcher at AZTI. My research interests include spatiotemporal dynamics of marine species, aquatic community ecology, fish stock assessment models, and individual-based models. I love dancing, cooking, and playing soccer. I speak Spanish, English, and some Italian.
