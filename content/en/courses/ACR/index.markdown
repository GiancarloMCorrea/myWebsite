subtitle: Common statistical techniques used in community ecology.
summary: Statistical basis of common techniques used in community ecology.
title: Community analysis with R
---

This course explores the statistical methods commonly used in community ecology using the R programming language. There is an important theoretical component since the basis of multivariate methods are introduced and analized carefully. It is organized by **Cousteau Consultant Group** and taught in six days, three hours per day. In this page you can find a brief summary of the topics and R codes discussed during this course. *Paola Galloso* is an important contributor to the material presented in this course. *Information presented here only available in Spanish. I hope to translate this material to English soon.*

## Course programme

The following topics are discussed:

- **Day 1:** Concepts in community ecology. Data exploration. Diversity indices.
- **Day 2:** Diversity types. Rarefaction. Species-abundance plots. Data transformation.
- **Day 3:** Distance measures. Cluster analysis. Species indicators.
- **Day 4:** Eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Unconstrained ordination: PCA.
- **Day 5:** Unconstrained ordination: CA and NMDS.
- **Day 6:** Canonical ordination: RDA and CCA. Beta diversity.

## Objectives

- Introduce concepts in community ecology
- Introduce statistical methods used in community analysis
- Familiarize with R libraries used in community analysis

## Prerequisite

* Basic statistic concepts
* Basic programming in the R language
