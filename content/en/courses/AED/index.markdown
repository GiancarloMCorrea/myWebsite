title: Analysis of ecological data with R
---

This course explores the statistical methods commonly used in ecology using the R programming language. It is an introductory course to fields in ecology such as: spatial ecology, community ecology, species distribution models, and time series analysis. It is taught in five days, three hours per day.

## Course programme

The following topics are discussed:

- **Day 1:** Basics of R programming. Descriptive statistics. Introduction to probability.
- **Day 2:** Hypothesis testing: one and two samples.
- **Day 3:** Linear models.
- **Day 4:** Introduction to time series analysis. Introduction to analysis of spatial data.
- **Day 5:** Introduction to community ecology. Types of diversity. Basics of cluster analysis.

## Objectives

- Introduce statistical concepts used in ecology
- Interpret statistical outcomes of statistical models
- Familiarize with the R programming language applied to ecology

## Prerequisite

* Basic statistic concepts
* Basic programming in R language
* Statistical basis of linear models
