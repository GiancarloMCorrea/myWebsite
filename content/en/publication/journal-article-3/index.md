abstract: Distinct types of fish species experience variation in somatic growth rates over 
  their life span; however, growth has historically been assumed to be invariant across time 
  and space in integrated analysis-based stock assessment. A few previous studies have reported 
  biased and imprecise assessment model outcomes when variability in somatic growth was ignored.
