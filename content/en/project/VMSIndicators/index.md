summary: Vessel monitoring system (VMS) is currently used in many fisheries worldwide. It provides data about the spatial location of fishing vessels with a certain frequency (typically 15 minutes). The stored data can be used to understand the movement and behavior of fishing vessels, and can be potentially used to infer spatial changes in the target stock. This library (VMSIndicators) implements some functions to understand changes in the efficiency of the Peruvian pelagic fleet using VMS data. A vignette is available.
