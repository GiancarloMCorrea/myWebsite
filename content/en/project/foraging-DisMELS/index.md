summary: In this project, I expaded the base features of DisMELS, an individual-based model used in the Alaska region. I added a foraging component to be able to model the prey perception, attack, and ingestion by fish larvae. Also, a new survival function was included. ROMS prey fields are required. It is applied to the Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea, but may be adapted to any species.
