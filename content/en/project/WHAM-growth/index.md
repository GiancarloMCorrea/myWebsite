summary: In this project, I expand the current features of WHAM. Length-structured information (e.g. length compositions) can be input into the model, as well as conditional length-at-age data. Selectivity-at-length options have been added. A length-weight relationship could be modeled in case weight-at-age data is not available. Two strategies to model mean length-at-age can be modeled by using a parametric growth equation or inputting mean length-at-age by the user. Random effects in parameters can be estimated.
