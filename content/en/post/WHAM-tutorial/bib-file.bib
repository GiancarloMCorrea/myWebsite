	abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two ap­ proaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework.},

abstract = {Specification of how selectivity (the combination of availability and vulnerability) is modelled in integrated stock assessments is key to avoiding bias in estimates of quantities of management interest. Many “rules of thumb” are common in the community but these have yet to be rigorously tested. This paper uses simulation to compare 12 approaches for specifying selectivity in an age-structured integrated stock assessment, including parametric and non-parametric approaches. The operating model represents a two-fishery case where selectivity for one or both fisheries can be dome-shaped and/or time-varying. The results suggest that using AIC to select among selectivity forms is not robust, including when model misspecification is absent, even though the use of model selection criteria such as AIC is common when conducting stock assessments. The use of double normal selectivity was found to be most robust to uncertainty in the true form of selectivity. Estimation of time-variation in selectivity did not lead to appreciable improvements in performance when the true time-variation was random. The double normal form performed poorly if M was estimated along with the other model parameters. Similarly, use of flexible parametric methods, such as splines, performed adequately with informative data, but poorly when the catch series exhibited low contrast and age-composition data were not available from the start of the fishery. This suggests that the best practices for selectivity will depend on knowledge of the likely information content of the data.}

This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleratisrt. Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gsmpertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier fomulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of ﬁsh assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can ﬂexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate ﬁshery management quantities such as ﬁshing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model conﬁgurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efﬁciently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},
