Here you can find the slides and examples that my colleague (Jane Sullivan, NOAA) and I made for the workshop 
*Assessment methods for stocks with little or no age data* organized by the *Ocean Frontier Institute* (Dalhousie University).

In our presentations, we provide a quick overview of the modeling of length information in the WHAM model, how to implement a model from
scratch, and several examples. All required files for the examples can be downloaded on this site.
