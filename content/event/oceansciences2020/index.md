abstract: Fish populations commonly exhibit spatial and temporal variability in somatic growth. 
  For instance, differences in oceanographic conditions between areas or years can drive 
  variation in rates of somatic growth, which increases variance in size-at-age at the population 
  scale. This increased size-at-age variance can lead to larger errors in age composition, or 
  the proportion of individuals at each age estimated from fisheries-dependent and -independent 
  data sources, a crucial input for stock assessment models. To evaluate approaches for reducing 
  these sources of error, we assess the performance of four methods for estimating age composition 
  of a simulated fish population with spatiotemporal variability in somatic growth two methods based 
  on the common approach of age-length keys (ALK) and two based on more novel applications of 
  statistical models (generalized additive models-GAMs and continuation ratio logits-CRLs). Our 
  simulations demonstrate that CRLs are more robust to estimate age compositions than ALKs. We 
  also apply these methods to estimate age compositions of the Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 
  in the Eastern Bering Sea, a species recently shown to exhibit spatiotemporal variation in 
  size-at-age, as a case study and compare their impact on stock assessment outputs. Consistent 
  with our simulations, Pacific cod stock assessment models using age compositions estimated 
  from CRLs show better fits than those using ALKs, resulting in smaller standard errors when 
  estimating spawning biomass. We conclude that statistical models have utility for estimating 
  age compositions employed in stock assessment models and should be the preferred approach for 
  fish populations with spatiotemporal variation in somatic growth.
