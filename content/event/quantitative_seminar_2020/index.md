abstract: Variation in somatic growth is common in fish populations but often ignored 
  when implementing stock assessment models, which can substantially impact model inputs 
  and outputs. Age composition is defined as the proportion of a fish population belonging 
  to each age class and is an informative input to stock assessment models. Classic methods 
  (e.g. age-length keys) to estimate age composition from length and age data do not normally 
  consider this type of variability, producing a need to look for alternative approaches. 
  Model-based methods to estimate age compositions have been proposed in previous studies 
  but their performance has not been evaluated when a significant variability in somatic 
  growth is present. On the other hand, the impacts of considering or ignoring spatial and 
  temporal variability in somatic growth in stock assessment model on outputs have rarely 
  been studied, and there are no conclusive results. Here, I will discuss why we need to look 
  for alternative approaches when estimating model inputs such as age composition, and the 
  need to implement stock assessment models that account for spatial and temporal variability 
  in somatic growth. Our results apply for distinct types of life histories and provide pertinent 
  information for stock assessment best practice guidelines.
