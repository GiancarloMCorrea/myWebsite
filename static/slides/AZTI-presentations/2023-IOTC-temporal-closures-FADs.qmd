## Introduction

<br>

Recent assessment models estimated the current status of tropical tunas in the Indian Ocean (IO):

-   Bigeye (BET): [overfished and subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.3)"}
-   Yellowfin (YFT): [overfished and subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(255,0,0,0.3)"}
-   Skipjack (SKJ): [not overfished and is not subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(115,245,139,0.3)"}

::: fragment
There is a need to implement measures to improve the status for BET and YFT.
:::

## Time-area closures

<br>

::: incremental

- Implemented to control fishing effort, to protect adults during spawning season, to allow growth of juveniles, to rebuild depleted stocks, or to protect bycatch species (IATTC, 2021).

- Seasonal closures are generally quite effective and easy to implement. 

- However, effort allocation during open seasons or areas might produce negative results.

:::

## Objectives

<br>

Evaluate the impacts of temporal and time-area closures on the future status of tropical tunas in the Indian Ocean (IO).

- Status evaluated using $SB/SB_{msy}$ and $F/F_{msy}$ at the end of a 10-year projection.

## Assessment model

<br>

* Use Stock Synthesis (SS3) [(Fu 2020, Fu et al. 2021, 2022)]{style="font-size:75%"} to make projections.

  - [SS3 configuration: steepness of 0.8, base growth and natural mortality, lambda of 1.]{style="font-size:75%"}

* Projected recruitment is deterministic from the SR relationship.

* Growth, selectivity, and other model components constant during the projection period.

## Catch projections

<br>

-   **TAC**: projected catch from TAC recommendation (YFT) or resolution (BET and SKJ, Resolution 23/04 and 16/02).

-   **Closures**: projected catch derived from *TAC* values. Then, we applied several fleet-specific temporal closures to the entire IO.

-   **LS-FS**: Interaction between the FAD and free school purse seine fisheries. 

## Closure strategies

<br>

::: incremental
* Closed quarter: Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 could be closed. 
* Closure duration: 3, 2, or 1 month.
* Catch reallocation: 100%, 50%, or 0% of the catch corresponding to the closed period could be redistributed among the open period (for fleet-specific closures). 
  + For LS-FS: Catch reallocation from LS to FS during the same period.
:::

## Catch reallocation

### TAC

#| echo: false
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = circle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen, fontsize=30]

Q1 [label = 'Quarter 1 \n Open', fillcolor = lightskyblue2]
Q2 [label = 'Quarter 2 \n Open', fillcolor = lightskyblue2]
Q3 [label = 'Quarter 3 \n Open', fillcolor = lightskyblue2]
Q4 [label = 'Quarter 4 \n Open', fillcolor = lightskyblue2]

{rank = min; Q1}
{rank = max; Q4}

edge [arrowhead = none]
Q1 -> Q2 -> Q3 -> Q4

}")
```

## Conclusions

We presented a coherent framework to assess the impacts of closure strategies on tropical tunas in the Indian Ocean.

<br>

::: fragment
By the terminal year of the projection period:

::: incremental
-   The TAC scenario produced a stock status [overfished and not subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(255,252,87,0.3)"} for BET and YFT and [not overfished and not subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(115,245,139,0.3)"} for SKJ.
:::

:::

## Conclusions

For closure scenarios, by the terminal year of the projection period:

::: incremental
-   Catch reallocation of 100% always produced a stock status as in the TAC scenario.

-   Closing all fleets during an entire quarter with 0% reallocation always produced a stock status [not overfished and not subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(115,245,139,0.3)"}.

-   Closing the PS-LS fishery produced the largest positive impact on the stock status compared to other fleet-specific closures, followed by BB (for BET) and GI and HD (for YFT).
:::

## Conclusions

<br>

For the LS-FS interaction, by the terminal year of the projection period:

-   Produced even larger positive impact on the stock status compared to fleet-specific closures.

-   Even considering a 100% reallocation, the stock status was [not overfished and not subject to overfishing]{style="background-color: rgba(115,245,139,0.3)"} in most cases for the three tuna stocks.
